Hi! I'm currently in my gap year as an "independent" researcher. <br>
I'm interested in reinforcement learning (RL), especially in theory.

I have completed my work on developing the optimality guarantee for Advantage-Weighted Regression (AWR), an iterative RL algorithm in which the policy is updated using standard regression.
If you would like to learn about my research background through a single paper, please check [this](../assets/AWR_Guarantees.pdf).

Please refer to my [research experience](https://ycz0512.github.io/portfolio/) for a sketch of my representative papers.

This is my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf) (updated: Jan 6, 2026).

I achieved my M.E. degree in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Tao Zhang and Xueqian Wang. 
Before that, I earned my B.E. degree in Automation from Hubei University of Technology.

**I’m actively seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD in related areas.**
