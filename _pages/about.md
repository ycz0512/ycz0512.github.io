Hi! I'm currently in my gap years as an "independent" researcher.    
I'm interested in reinforcement learning (RL), especially in theory.

Recently, I finished my work on developing the optimality guarantee for the advantage-weighted regression (AWR),
an iterative RL algorithm in which the policy is updated using standard regression.
If you want to know my research background through one paper, please check [this](../assets/AWR_Guarantees.pdf).

I achieved my M.E. degree in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Tao Zhang and Xueqian Wang. Before that, I earned my B.E. degree in Automation from Hubei University of Technology.

This is my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf). (updated Jan 5, 2025)

**Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD in related areas.**
